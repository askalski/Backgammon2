This is a simple C# implementation of Backgrammon game with a-little-better-than-random AI.
I use canvas for procedural drawing and basic geometry tests for picking.

It was written by me as my home-assignment for C# classes at University of Warsaw, somewhere in 2009/2010 academic year.

It has a main window scaling issue (written in non-standard dpi and hardcoded some value).
